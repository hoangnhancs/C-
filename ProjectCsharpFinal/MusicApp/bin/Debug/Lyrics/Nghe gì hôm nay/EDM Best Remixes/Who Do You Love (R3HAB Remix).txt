Found cigarettes in your Fendi coat
Even though you don't even smoke
Always changin' your access codes
Yeah, I can tell you no one knew

[Pre-Chorus: Luke Hemmings]
Yeah, you've been actin' so conspicuous
You flip it on me, say I think too much
You're movin' different when we makin' love
Baby, tell me, tell me

[Chorus: Luke Hemmings & Ashton Irwin]
Who do you love, do you love now?
I wanna know the truth (Whoa)
Who do you love, do you love now?
I know it's someone new
You ain't gotta make it easy, where you been sleepin'?
This *** is keepin' me up at night, just admit it
Who do you love, do you love now?
I wanna know, I wanna know who
I wanna know

[Verse 2: Calum Hood]
Well, keep switchin' your alibi
Or stutterin' when you reply
You can't even look me in the eye
Oh, I can tell, I know you're lyin'

[Pre-Chorus: Calum Hood]
'Cause you've been actin' so conspicuous
You flip it on me, say I think too much
We're movin' different while we're makin' love
So, baby, tell me, tell me

[Chorus: Luke Hemmings & Ashton Irwin]
Who do you love, do you love now?
I wanna know the truth (Whoa)
Who do you love, do you love now?
I know it's someone new
You ain't gotta make it easy, where you been sleepin'?
This *** is keepin' me up at night, just admit it
Who do you love, do you love now?
I wanna know, I wanna know who
I wanna know
Who do you love, do you love now?
I wanna know the truth
Who do you love, do you love now?
I wanna know, I wanna know who
